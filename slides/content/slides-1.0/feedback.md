[TL;DR: Please answer these five questions.](https://forms.gle/GVBzDjYxRgDm5Saa6)

I started this piece months ago, and have been working on it during nights and weekends.  As I dug into the question of who actually got Trump elected, it kept getting larger: "But what about religion effects?  Military service?"  You have seen the charts and story that made the most sense to me, with dead ends left out.

This work is obviously not done; there are more states to cover, and we haven't really touched "But *why* did noncollege whites vote like this?"  However, after over half a year of work, I need to draw the line somewhere to start getting feedback from real people.  My test readers have said encouraging things, but what do **you** think?

Please give me feedback!  It helps me improve and produce better work.  [I have a small Google form if you'd be kind enough to tell me what you think.](https://forms.gle/GVBzDjYxRgDm5Saa6)

The next presidential election is coming, and we don't have much time to waste.  Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.  If this has been a helpful essay for you, please let me know.
