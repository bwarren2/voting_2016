[TL;DR: Please answer these five questions.](https://forms.gle/GVBzDjYxRgDm5Saa6)

# Who elected Trump?

We started with a question: which demographic got Donald Trump elected?  From the analysis I have done, it appears straightforward: **disengaged voters, primarily noncollege, primarily white people who voted for a Democrat in the past (Obama), but didn't show up to vote the same way for Hillary.  Often, these people reside in places hit hard by declining American manufacturing, where noncollege high-wage jobs (like mining) are disappearing.**

# Why does this matter?

This conclusion is important because it shuts off distractions.  While it may _feel_ good and important to rail against racist Republican voters, they are not the ones that made the biggest difference to turn the tide in key states; in several states, including Iowa and Wisconsin, the Republican vote was almost totally unchanged.  Indulging those feelings at the expense of building a platform and a party that can win back lost voters may be a recipe for disaster.

Further, when appealing to disengaged noncollege voters is important, it tells us what to emphasize and what to discourage.  We should place more of a premium on Dem candidates that can go to neutral/hostile places and persuade, and less on the candidates that merely reinforce the feelings of committed Democratic voters.  [Elizabeth Warren](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/11/warren-west-virginia-2020-1317611), [Bernie Sanders](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/439027-sanders-townhall-audience-cheers-after-fox-news-host-asks-if-theyd-support), and [Pete Buttigieg](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/19/us/politics/buttigieg-fox-town-hall.html) at least have done this.  We should also discourage candidates that drive away uncommitted/swing voters with more ardent appeals to the base or attacks to stay in the race.

We _should not_ merely support the people that feel best to us specifically.  We should support the candidates that can win the most votes, especially the votes that could have won the 2016 election.

# Feedback requested

I started this piece months ago, and have been working on it during nights and weekends.  As I dug into the question of who actually got Trump elected, it kept getting larger: "But what about religion effects?  Military service?"  You have seen the charts and story that made the most sense to me, with dead ends left out.

This work is obviously not done; there are more states to cover, and we haven't really touched "But *why* did noncollege whites vote like this?"  However, after over half a year of work, I need to draw the line somewhere to start getting feedback from real people.  My test readers have said encouraging things, but what do **you** think?

Please give me feedback!  It helps me improve and produce better work.  [I have a small Google form if you'd be kind enough to tell me what you think.](https://forms.gle/GVBzDjYxRgDm5Saa6)

The next presidential election is coming, and we don't have much time to waste.  Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.  If this has been a helpful essay for you, please let me know.
