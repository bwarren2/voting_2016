![Raw education vs republican shift scatter](/ed_scatter.png)

We can start to investigate the drivers of 2012->2016 Republican voting shift by examining the characteristics of each county.  Here we see what fraction of a county has a high school degree or less vs the 2016 shift toward Trump.

We can see [on the map]({{< ref "overperformance_map" >}}) that the low outliers are Utah and Idaho.  This makes sense; McMullin was a spoiler candidate for Republicans in those states and especially popular among Mormons, who disliked Trump.

When we remove Idaho and Utah, the relationship becomes a bit clearer, but is still a drumstick instead of the line that would indicate a clean relationship.  What if we consider the oft-cited influence of [race in the election?]({{< ref "race_scatter" >}})
